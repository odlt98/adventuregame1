PYTHON

Feel free to run and build to the program.
You can do this my editing the Python file thourgh IDLE

Naming conventions:
Some of the variables are relating to the initial action. For example if you go to the inn in chapter 1, the following
variable for that action would be "inn1"
The functions for each chapter follow the format of actionChapter.


The program is built over a few functions some being recursive.

Some of it I think is sloppy, but it works.

To start the program simply double click! or Run through Python IDLE.

Thanks for playing and contributing.
